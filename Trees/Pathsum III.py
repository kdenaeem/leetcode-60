# Given a binary tree and a target value
# the value in every node is negative or positive
# return the number of paths in the tree 
# that are equal to the target value

# solution
# traverse the tree and add, if the addition is equal to target
# save this in an array
# traversing the left and right nodes must appear in the function
# recursively calling the function itself on the left and right children
